            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>The Fitness Tracker website provides you with the tools to help you keep track of your weight loss progress. 
            This website has the ability to record the nutrition and fitness data for each day, upload and export this data in a csv format,
            plot the data, and predict how much weight will be gained or lost.</p>
            
            <h3>Main Page</h3>
            <p>The main page contains a table in which you can enter in nutrition data for the food you eat each day. 
            For each entry, you must include the food name, and number of calories, protein, carbohydrates, and sugars for that type of food.
            You can click the “+” button to add and entry and the “-“ button to delete an entry. Each entry entered will be saved in the database.
            When you search for the food name again, you can choose the suggested food name in the input box and use the autopopulated values for the
            nutrition data.</p> 

            <p>You must also enter in how much you weigh that day in the input on the top left. The previous and next buttons allow you to see
             nutrition and weight data for the previous and next days. You can also click on the date on the top left and select any date on the
            calendar to see the nutrition data for that day.</p>

            <p>You can use the predict button to predict tomorrow's weight based on the nutrition data for today. In order to get the most accurate
            results, make sure you enter in data for nutrition and weight for every day. You must be accurate with the data in order for the learner
            to be accurate. The learner uses multiple linear regression to predict the weight. It uses the the values for weight, calories, protein,
            carbohydrates, and sugars from previous days in order to estimate your weight for the next day. The learner also displays the mean squared
            error of the estimate. The closer to zero the mean squared error is, the better the estimate is.</p>

            <h3>Graph</h3>
            <p>The graphs page generates a plot of how much you weigh each day and how much weight you gain or lose each day. These charts 
            are generated from the data entered in the Fitness Tracker website. You can use these charts to visualize your weight loss progress.
            The first chart shows the weight for each day. The second chart shows the change in weight per day.</p>

            <h3>Files</h3>
            <p>The files page allows you to manage the data uploaded to the website. To upload data, you must use a csv file formatted with
            columns labeled for weight, food name, calories, protein, carbohydrates, and sugars. All files uploaded to the Fitness Tracker website
            are displayed in the table. You can delete a file by pressing the “x” button. You can also use the a file as the overall data for the
            website by pressing the “Use File” button. Please note that doin so deletes all previous data saved in the current session. Pressing 
            the download button allows you to download the current data on the website as a csv file. </p>
